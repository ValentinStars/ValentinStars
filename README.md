# Hi, I'm Valentin Stars

I’m a self-taught developer who’s obsessed with figuring out how computers tick—down to the metal. Think hardware, firmware, and the guts of architecture. I geek out over stuff like BIOS/UEFI internals, Super I/O chips, LPC buses, and even reverse-engineering PC motherboards. It’s not just about poking at things until they break (though I’m guilty of that)—it’s about *getting* how it all works.

I bounce between languages like **Lua, Python, Bash, ASM, C, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, depending on what I’m messing with. Right now, I’m digging deeper into **C++** to write slicker, faster code for system-level projects—because who doesn’t love a performance boost?

High-level scripting like Python or Lua is my go-to for quick tools or automation, but my heart’s really in the low-level world—writing assembly or C to talk straight to the hardware. Web stuff? I dabble when I need to (think APIs or bot interfaces), but I’d rather be elbows-deep in a machine’s internals any day.

# Stuff I’ve Built

I love tinkering—some of my projects are practical tools I use all the time, others are just me experimenting and learning. Here’s a peek at what I’ve been up to:

### Low-Level & Firmware Goodies
- **BIOS/Flash Dumper Toolchain**  
  A little setup I made to read, write, and tweak SPI flash chips using microcontrollers. Perfect for anyone into firmware hacking—or just breaking into their own hardware.  
- **Assembly Bootloader Experiments**  
  Me trying to write x86 boot code from the ground up. It’s been a wild ride learning how BIOS does its thing—super satisfying when it actually boots!  
- **Super I/O Probe**  
  A script I whipped up to sniff out and decode Super I/O chip registers. If you’re into retro hardware, this one’s a lifesaver.  

### Bots & Fun APIs
- **Multi-Platform Bot Framework**  
  I built this to reuse code across Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp bots. Keeps things simple when you’re juggling multiple chat platforms.  
- **Minecraft Player API**  
  A neat API that grabs user data, avatars, and server details for Minecraft players. It’s a fun mashup of my gaming and coding sides.  
- **Moderation + Entertainment Bot**  
  A Discord bot packed with admin tools and silly commands. It’s been a blast learning bot dev while keeping server chaos in check.  

### Hardware & Embedded Experiments
- **Bare-metal Arduino/ESP32 Projects**  
  Me playing with low-level timing, memory, and port control—no libraries, just raw code. Great for getting cozy with embedded systems.  
- **Custom Protocol over GPIO**  
  A quirky experiment with bitbanging and timing-sensitive data over GPIO pins. Niche? Sure. Fun? Absolutely.

# What I’m Learning Next

I’m always chasing something new to wrap my head around. Here’s what’s on my radar right now:  
- Getting better at **C++** for systems programming—faster, tighter code is the goal.  
- Digging into **PC buses** like LPC, SPI, and SMBus—key stuff for hardware hacking.  
- Figuring out how to write **custom firmware** for PC parts—tough, but so cool.  
- Sharpening my skills at **reversing binary formats**—it’s like cracking a code, and I’m hooked.  
- Exploring **ethical hacking and security**—using my powers for good to make tech safer.

# How I Roll

> "Know the machine, control the machine."  

I’m all about learning by doing. Sure, tutorials are nice, but I’d rather rip something apart, poke at it, and build it back my way—even if it’s messy or crashes a few times. That’s how you *really* understand tech. I love questioning everything, experimenting like crazy, and ending up with something that’s mine, quirks and all.
