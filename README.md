# 👋 Hi — I’m **Valentin Stars**
I’m a kid who loves tearing apart computers (figuratively and sometimes literally), digging into firmware, and building tools that are useful — or just hilarious — for debugging and exploration.  
I love low-level work: BIOS & flash hacking, Super I/O probing, bare-metal microcontroller projects, writing small bootloaders, and crafting multi-platform bots that actually behave.

> **Style:** dark, teal/blue accents, a little noisy, a little sarcastic. Human-first wording — not a robotic CV.

## 🎛️ Live terminal (animated)
This is a typed animation (SVG) that simulates a real terminal printing my motto and a few lines. It looks alive in the README and fits the dark hacker vibe.

**Terminal**

> If you want a different terminal text or more lines (for example, dynamic outputs like `probe: SuperIO found: <model>`), I’ll add them — tell me what exact lines you want typed.

## 🔧 What I actually do (short)
- Build **BIOS / SPI flash dumper** toolchains using microcontrollers for SPI reading/writing.  
- Write **assembly bootloader experiments** to learn how x86/boot works from scratch.  
- Reverse-engineer **Super I/O** registers and probe vintage hardware.  
- Create **single-core bot frameworks** that run on Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, VK with shared business logic.  
- Make **bare-metal** Arduino / ESP32 projects — no libraries, pure registers.  
- Build small **APIs** for projects (Minecraft player info, server status).  
- Practice **ethical hacking & pentesting** to improve system security (tools, Termux utilities, reconnaissance, flows).

## 🧩 Projects (selected — with small, honest commentary)
- **BIOS / Flash Dumper Toolchain** — microcontroller-based SPI dumper + flasher. Useful for recovery and analysis.  
- **Assembly Bootloader Experiments** — tiny bootloaders that taught me what REAL control over boot looks like. No fluff.  
- **Super I/O Probe** — a script/tool that probes Super I/O chips and decodes registers for retro boards.  
- **Multi-Platform Bot Framework** — one core, multiple adapters (Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, VK). Shared commands, shared logic.  
- **Minecraft Player API** — small, fast API to fetch player avatars, server pings and simple stats.  
- **Bare-metal Arduino/ESP32** — simple drivers, I2C/bit-banging protocols, SSD1306 display proofs of concept.

---

## 📚 Learning & Goals (what I’m grinding on)
- Master **C++** for performance-critical, low-level control.  
- Deep dive into PC buses: **LPC, SPI, SMBus** and how motherboards whisper to peripherals.  
- Write **custom firmware** and firmware tools for motherboards.  
- Level up in **reverse engineering**, binary analysis, and safe pentesting procedures.  
- Become fluent with **ESP-IDF** and advanced microcontroller toolchains.

---

## 🧠 Recent chat topics / things I ask about a lot
(quick, honest list — what I test and research daily)
- Termux & essential pentest utilities (install commands, usage examples).  
- Nmap basics and advanced scanning patterns.  
- BIOS / UEFI internals, Super I/O register maps.  
- ESP32 (GyverPortal, Gyver libs, bare-metal use).  
- Assembly curiosities and tiny boot sector experiments.  
- SSL certs, self-signed vs Let’s Encrypt workflows.  
- Redirecting traffic / local proxying + using microcontrollers as gateways.  
- Minecraft server internals / APIs and player queries.

---

## 🎒 Fun facts (human side)
- I love cycling — summer is pedal season, winter is code season.  
- I have a stubborn cat named **Bazzilio** (claims ownership of the desk).  
- I accidentally deleted a Minecraft city once — and rebuilt something better.  
- I prefer to learn by breaking things and putting them back together — faster that way.

---

## 🧭 How I work (my approach)
I try to be pragmatic and honest:
- keep code readable when necessary, obfuscate for specific tests when needed;  
- prefer minimal dependencies and pure register control on embedded;  
- automate tasks I do more than twice;  
- test in safe environments and respect legality — pentesting is ethical and permission-based.
