- ⚡ Fun fact:
- Did you know that the longest password you can create in Windows is 127 characters?
- However, it is interesting that Windows only takes into account the first 14 characters when checking a password.
- This means that if your password is 15 characters long and the first 14 characters are the same as another user's password, you will be able to log in with their account!
